# Implementation of recursion

## santa.py
There is a wish list of different weight of gifts. The santa's goal is to take as much gift as he can.
He don't have to take all the gifts, but on the other hands, he cannot continuously dump two gifts. That is, if he take gift *i*, he cannot dump gift *i + 1*. And the output is the maximum weight he take.
